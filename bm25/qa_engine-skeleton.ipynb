It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles, and faded my darkest age spots.They're not gone completely, but definitely less noticeable. My skin tone is much more even. I use it morning and night. My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I've used has caused breakouts. I get none with this stuff. My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes, I use Cetaphil moisturizer... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning. Very happy with this product, which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it's fancy advertising.\n",
